# BirdIdentifier
Bird Identifier is a web app that uses machine learning to help users identify birds in their pictures. It's pretty self explanatory.

This contains the backend code that does the heavy lifting.

The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/adamgate/BirdIdentifier-Frontend).
