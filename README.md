# BirdIdentifier
Bird Identifier is a web app that uses machine learning to help users identify birds in their pictures. 

The machine learning model was implemented using ML.NET and their image classification model, that was trained with a dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species), to allow for identification of 400 different bird species.

This repo contains the backend code that does the heavy lifting to identify a bird and link the user to more information.

The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/adamgate/BirdIdentifier-Frontend).
