# BirdIdentifier
Bird Identifier is a web app that uses machine learning to help users identify birds in their pictures. 

The machine learning model was implemented using ML.NET and their image classification model, that was trained with a dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species), to allow for identification of 500 different bird species.
